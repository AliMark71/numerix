# Contributing to Numerix

:+1::tada: Thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the Numerix package. Submitted code that does not conform to these guidelines will not be merged into the package. Feel free to propose changes to this document in a Pull Request or Issue.

## Code style

Use the [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) tool to enforce Swift code styles and conventions. See the `.swiftlint.yml` file for disabled rules and other settings.

## Documentation

The [DocC](https://www.swift.org/documentation/docc/) tool is used to generate documentation for the Numerix package. The documentation is hosted by the Swift Package Index. All submitted code should have documentation comments that are compatible with DocC.

## Tests

The [Swift Testing](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/) framework is used for creating and running tests. New tests should be added where appropriate and existing tests should pass for submitted code.

## Pull requests

Fork this repository and create a new branch with your contributions. Then create a pull request to the main branch of the Numerix repository. Only pull requests that have been properly styled, documented, and tested (as discussed above) will be considered for merging.
